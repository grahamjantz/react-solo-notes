# Solo Notes React App

This project is being created as my first react project without following a tutorial. As the project grows I will document challenges I faced and how I worked through them using the react documentation and online sources such as StackOverflow.

I have named my app Solo Notes to reflect that this project is being done solo, on my own, not following an online tutorial.

I feel I have a lot to learn about React and I hope this app and future ones help me better understand this powerful framework.
